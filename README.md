# aiv-tween
Aiv.Tween portable .Net module. Tested with AIV libraries and Unity3D

This is a reflection-based Tween implementation + a bunch of Easing functions taken from the https://github.com/tweenjs/tween.js project

Usage
-----

Each animation sequence should be mapped to a `Aiv.Tween.Tween` Object:

```cs

using Aiv.Tween;

...

Tween idleAnimation = new Tween();

```
